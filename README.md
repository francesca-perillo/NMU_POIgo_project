# PoiGo!
## Introduction
<p align="justify"> The technological innovation and the emergence of digital technologies applied to the urban context means that the city is defined, on some aspects, as intelligent. The intelligent use of information to support the mobility and movement of people and goods defines the concept of Infomobility. Systems are increasingly accessible via the Internet; the growing demand for stored information is increasing. With the spread of Android iPhones and smartphones through mobile applications, infomobility is at hand and it follows that systems must be immediate and effective. From the increasing amount of information, it follows that there is an optimized data organization. In fact, the multiplicity of applications makes it necessary to aim at the concept of centrality: unifying the information in a single interface accessible well organized.</p>

### Objective of the system
<p align="justify"> The aim of the system is to provide the user with effective retrieval of infomobility information by sharing information resulting from the centralization of data that can flow from external sources, aiming to create a single niche reference point through an application developed for the main mobile devices. </p>

### Scope of the system
<p align="justify"> The scope of the system consists in developing a mobile application for both iPhone and Android smartphone that allows the centralized retrieval of information related to integrated infomobility, through a semantic organization of information with the development of a user-friendly interface for the end user. Another crucial aspect for the validity of the platform is the centralized management of information through the implementation of the system based on a hierarchical structure of permissions on the functionality of the same. </p>

### Objectives and success criteria
The objectives of NMU City Roaming are:
- compliance with agreed targets and coverage of Functional Requirements (RF) of higher priority;
- the respect of the budget is of time that of cost, against which, to depending on the importance attached to this criterion, it must be defined an acceptable deviation;
- compliance with deadlines, which may be rigid or present a degree, even wide, of flexibility;
- compliance with quality requirements, such as interface design, efficiency, maintenance, safety and flexibility of insertion, management and retrieval of information;
- the satisfaction of stakeholders on the basis of what was expressed during the evaluation of the project and the system. This is based on compliance of the previously discussed criteria and on the usefulness, quality assessed on the frequency of use as an expression of appreciation of users.

## Current system
<p align="justify"> There is currently no centralised and active infomobility system.
However, a dot.net prototype was designed in an alpha version
consisting of a navigation and infomobility system called "Ci.ro.",
acronym for City Roaming. This system was available for installed tablets
on board vehicles and provided a number of features such as navigation
semantics based on an area of interest (in terms of catering, shopping,
tourism, art and culture, etc.): the user could search for a place of interest
specializing their demand between dynamic categories and subcategories.
In addition, the user could search for themed routes or take advantage of the classic
navigation by address. The system provided for the calculation of the distance and
creation of a virtual wallet for any payments along the way
(e.g. paid parking). NMU City Roaming is established in the need
common to move from specialized logic to vehicle, to an open system
and accessible to all.</p>

## Proposed system
<p align="justify"> NMU City Roaming was born as a solution to the difficulties of consumer users
and in particular of travellers, as it solves the problems caused
the use of existing systems, whether automated or not. Such a proposal
has the dual aim of providing, in the first place, a centralized support
for the purposes of the POI search (restaurants, shops, museums, events, etc.) and, according to
place, to allow a merchant to sponsor their POI.
Anyone planning to search for places of various areas of interest (in
terms of catering, shopping, tourism, art and culture, etc.)
the following application for a fast and targeted identification of POI,
through two main types of navigation: </p>

- **NS**:specialized navigation on a semantic basis, which provides for the choice between
Thematic Routes (PT) and Areas of Interest (AOI) (shopping, food and wine,
art and history, etc.): this choice is specialized in both cases,
bringing the Consumer User to choose between
theme in the first case, and between several then in the second case, filtered based
previous preferences;

- **NC**: classic navigation by address, which offers the possibility of having the usual
aerial view of the path to follow to arrive from a point of
departure to a predetermined point of arrival.
<p align="justify"> There will be a calendar with the most relevant cultural events of the
area and a section that will allow the reporting of discomforts, hazards or emergencies.
Such reports will be received, through notifications, from
users near the place concerned. The mobile application will be available
in Italian and English.
A web panel will be developed to support this
user, POI, reporting and event management capabilities. Each POI will be accompanied by a series of characterizing information
and from a connection to the satellite navigator, in order to reach
easily the destination. The POI can be _generic_ or _certified_: </p>

- information on generic POI is acquired from available data sources
discreetly. Such POIs will be marked on the map with icons
smaller and less marked;

- the information about the POI certificate is entered by the same POI User
by accessing the dedicated section of the web panel. For each
THEN you want to enter you must subscribe to a subscription, the
cost is closely dependent on the length of the period (quarterly-monthly
half-yearly-yearly) so the POI will remain visible.

Users using NMU city roaming can be divided into
four categories:

1. _Administrator_: Acts only via web panel. Registers the
POI Manager and enable the POI User who requested registration.
Has the ability to view and edit information
of all users, in addition to being able to delete, disable or reactivate the
profiles. In addition, valid the reports sent by Consumer Users, i
inserted by POI User and insert the events in the calendar;

2. _POI Manager_: acts only via web panel. Enable POI
Users who have requested registration and have the possibility of
view and modify the information of the POI User, in addition to being able to
delete, deactivate or reactivate profiles. In addition, valid alerts
sent by the Consumer User, the POI entered by the POI User and inserts the
calendar events;

3. _POI User_: business user acting solely via web panel.
You can register but you need to enable the profile in order to enter
the information of its POI, subject to the subscription of a
subscription. After validation, the POI User can edit the information
the POI entered and the payment data (e.g. the related data
to your credit/debit card, the type of subscription you use
...);

4. _Consumer User_: End user who downloads the mobile application and
use the available features.
